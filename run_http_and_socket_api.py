    Attempt to cleanly stop the running API processes.

    The socket and HTTP servers are continuously running processes, so we cannot simply join() on them and wait for
     them to finish.  Instead, clean up as we can and then terminate the procs.

     Note that a sigkill cannot be caught.

    Flask/HTTP close process:
        - stop pulling work off of the queue
        - let currently running methods finish.
        - terminate proc

    Socket shutdown process:
        - shutdown() to stop rx/tx, sending FIN/EOF.
        - close() to decrement a handle counter to the socket. if socket was shutdown, this should mean deallocation

        Shutdown options:
            0 - no more rx (SHUT_RD)
            1 - no more tx (SHUT_WR)
            2 - no more rx/tx (SHUT_RDWR)

        More verbosely:
        1) server "no more data will be sent" .shutdown(1)
        2) client receives and finishes sending its data to server, who is still listening for N duration
        3) client "no more data will be sent" .shutdown(1) -- could also optionally SHUT_RD or close at this point
        4) server receives #3 from all clients, can do a shutdown(2) if wanted or just close socket
